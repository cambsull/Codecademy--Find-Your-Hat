/* "Find Your Hat" challenge
Create a board utilizing the provided characters that accepts user input to move the player character along a path until they either

move out of bounds, fall into a hole, or find their hat.

Notes: This works, however there are several ways it can be improved in the future:

- Currently the userMoves() method handles pretty much everything, which could be improved by creating more methods to check for
hole and hat position in order to create better separation of concerns.

- The game can generate maps that are impossible to solve, such as trapping the player between holes at the start of the game. To
solve this would probably require a maze-solving algorithm, which is something I may return to and implement in the future.

-Currently there's no functionality to start a new game short of running the file again. Would be fairly trivial to remedy.

-Could spruce this up wtih other packages that do things like launching the game in a window or utilizing icons for better graphics.

-Could add functionality to set a percentage of holes in order to change difficulty. */
